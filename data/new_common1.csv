0,"Response 1: jesus, what a rock star. like helen keller on cocaine and crystal meth. i was diagnosed with aspergers' when i was about 12, and i have to say that she is much more inspirational in her talks than in her writing. 
 Response 2: it starts from within, & ""follow your own dream uninvited""! i really like his definition of apathy - it's a complex web!"
1,"Response 1: sadly people have not noticed the end of her talk. it carries the actual gist. if you don't feel for humaneness, you would not like to agree to this talk and construct any ways of revisiting our core practices. 
 Response 2: there is very simple way to turn ""bad stress"" to ""good stress"" used by special forces around the world. simple thing that you have to learn to do is following: forget about results, don't think about a result, don't care about any result, simply focus on your performance itself."
2,"Response 1: remember that a few years ago, you play albums backwards there are satanic messages? let me tell you something, if you've ever sat around playing your albums backwards, you are satan. bill hicks :) 
 Response 2: sad that some people would challenge this without knowing the facts. maybe she really can't say how she escaped, for fear of harming others chances. we don't know. but we don't accuse either.  maybe you should think before you level judgement too."
3,"Response 1: it starts from within, & ""follow your own dream uninvited""! i really like his definition of apathy - it's a complex web! 
 Response 2: i love listening to evelyn, she shares her understanding of sound so brilliantly. sharing her experiences as a deaf musician, she encourages us all to listen to music and ourselves differently...wonderful."
4,"Response 1: hello yoav,  my brother had tumor (endo-supra-ante-retro). he had an operation and radio therapy but a part of his tumor was not removed and this tumor produces hormons of growth.  do you do operation for this kind of tumor? 
 Response 2: phil, i also am an artist (and an art teacher) with a tremor in my right hand.  i would love to talk to you about your journey! iteachart2000@yahoo.com"
5,"Response 1: upon watching this idea, i predict mike rowe will run as a candidate (of any kind) for/in ca within the next 10 years. he doesn't want to do it (but will eventually with success and purpose) and he is fighting himself like no other from the inevitable. 
 Response 2: nice talk it's really enjoyable to be wrong how exciting it is when you laugh on your own mistake....."
6,"Response 1: it is a great speech indeed. however, he seems to miss out on medias. when you see that a channel called ""good food"" broadcast a show such as ""man vs. food"", this is a real disgrace. 
 Response 2: i agree with her, cuz dissent is a need today, before iraq war , bush did  blindly what his few experts told him to do , but they were all wrong"
7,"Response 1: this is a great guy. i still can't believe how is it possible to build streets with no sidewalks... in europe it's unbelievable. it's like shooting yourself in the knee. sounds like building a prison. where did your democracy go, guys? 
 Response 2: i see this so much in my sister.  she is constantly texting on her phone and on facebook, and she is an absolute failure at actually connecting to people.  she does not know how to have a healthy relationship or how to treat people with respect."

 Response 2: jesus lived vulnerably.  he lived to show all mankind that we are worthy of god's love.  jesus lived and died so that we can live whole-hearted.  through faith in jesus, and his perfection that is imputed to me by faith -- i am ""good enough""."
10,"Response 1: i loved this talk. but if the liar knows what signs give him away won't he become a better liar? 
 Response 2: very inspiring to see such youngsters tackling  a huge problem of plastic waste in such an innovative form. their curiosity, research and thirst of knowledge led them to this (accidental) discovery. absolutely brilliant and well done !"
11,"Response 1: did you notice his uncanny resemblance to yuri gagarin?

13,"Response 1: he is a brilliant talented stand-up comedian but surely not an artist. i enjoyed the first 2 minutes and then i started to feel uneasy and depressed with his views and his impersonating techniques. the real difficulty in art and design is to select one concept not 100.

 Response 2: what an inspiration this women is.. & it all comes down to truth.. she is honest & not scared to face her fears.. & doesn't take herself too seriously"" you are that i am that we are all that!"""
18,"Response 1: my advice, just quit your jobs, and become a fanatical stephan harris groupie, following them everywhere. i just want to hang out, and forget everything else. drink fresh dark coffee, and drift away, on the frequencies. ya dig daddy o. 
 Response 2: i'm interested to know how somebody who feels they are suspected of lying would behave, who feel their innocence is challenged. are their behaviour patterns similar?"
19,"Response 1: this is a very interesting talk. i wish he explains more about his discovery. anyways, does this mean that in every family there will be bad news at some point? hmm...

 Response 2: the one example that bothered me in an otherwise brilliant talk, was the image of dick chaney.  i'm not a big fan but i think that is just his face.  his lip is always slightly up in the corner.  either he is always contemptuous or that is his physical makeup."

27,"Response 1: how awesome was that?  the great part was him thinking out loud and ""showing"" us what was going on in his head.  if we can get kids to do this we might be able to help them and/or us be better learners and teachers.
