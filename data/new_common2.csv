4,"Response 1: okay i'm a gamer and i'm passionate about it but your conference is just not convincing enough. your claims are so big but your supporting ideas are suffering from lack of reality.  you might be right, but you just couldn't show it to me. 
 Response 2: i wish my naughty labrador rumi could be trained by ian! still i love her and she does understand english - sit, biscuit, food, ball are all very clear to her."

6,"Response 1: his language is at the same level as the archutecture and city planning he reffers to. and of course, insult the bulgarians while you're at it... he does have a point, but the delivery is so crass... 
 Response 2: brilliant. still ....if he says it is actually cheap technology, why are they charging so much for computer interfaces such as the jazz mutant lemur & dexter, monome & tendori-on."

10,"Response 1: a bright, delightful gentleman, but missing the point.  when you lose your precious data, you lose your visualization.  then what do you have?  by the way, all of america's wealth can go to zero in the blink of an eye.  bibbity-bobbity-boo! 
 Response 2: total flop. i think i would've liked a little history about the people she spoke of. i knew none of them or anything about them; or her. i did like the broken japanese vase, and her unbroken one. i also liked her mentioning of the void!"
